The PRU executables required to run the examples may be compiled with either
the `clpru` assembler (`.asm` files) or the `pasm` assembler (`.pasm` files),
using respectively:

$ make asm

or:

$ make pasm

The former assumes that `clpru` and `hexpru` are both in the $PATH.
The latter assumes that `pasm` is in the $PATH.
